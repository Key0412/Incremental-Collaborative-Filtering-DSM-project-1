# Incremental-Collaborative-Filtering-DSM-project-1

In this project I developed a python implementation of the Incremental Collaborative Filtering Recommendation algorithm by Papagelis et al.

The movielens 100k dataset is used (https://www.kaggle.com/c/movielens-100k). 
The implementation only uses the Nummpy package.
More information and examples of usage in the pdf User Guide and in the notebook Incremental Collaborative Filtering (ICF) implementation - Example of usage.
